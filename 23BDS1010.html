<h2>How to Code effectively</h2>
<p>HI GUYS, I recently found that coding is as easier as passing the 10th board exam.
 You just have to practice it once a day for one hour.
 It seems difficult but it is as easy as scrolling instagram reels.</p>

 <p id="LAB1">The key to mastering coding, just like any other skill, lies in consistent practice.
 Initially, the concepts might seem overwhelming, but once you break them down and approach them with patience, they begin to make sense.
 Just like how we scroll through Instagram without thinking, coding can become second nature if you dedicate just one hour a day. </p>
